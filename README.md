# Stock-Price-Predictions
This is my first project on quantitative currency.
In this Jupyter Notebook, I've applied LSTM RNN and some machine learning model, by using strong algorithm with Technical Indicators namely Simple Moving Average (SMA), to predict the price of 4 Stocks. We can improve the efficiency by adding more parameters to our model.
